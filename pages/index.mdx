# Random Emojis

A live feed of random emojis using Cloudflare, WebSockets and Redux.

<App />

## User Stories

As one of Cadell's friends, I want a live feed of random emojis that I can add to so I can send and receive random emojis for some mild amusement.

As Cadell, I want to build a realtime application using WebSockets and Cloudflare because they're all cool and I haven't used any of them before.

As Cadell, I want to build a stateful application using Cloudflare's Durable Objects so I can decide whether to use it for future applications, like [Very Nested](https://verynested.cadell.dev).

## Background

Cloudflare is pretty hot at the moment. They've announced [R2](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28682237) which is a cheap alternative to AWS S3 with a smooth migration path, making for some serious competition to AWS, [Cloudflare Pages has gone full stack](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29253032) allowing you to deploy fullstack applications with ease and Durable Objects is a new kind of data store that [sounds really interesting](https://blog.cloudflare.com/durable-objects-easy-fast-correct-choose-three/).

I've got a soft spot for stateful applications because they let people interact with each other and that can be fun! I made a chat app 12 years ago in high school using a LAMP stack and free hosting which would later go on to get hacked, leaking my severely reused password to the world. But before that, my friends played with my chat app and we had some laughs.

I recently deployed [PRAwN Stack](https://prawn.cadell.dev) on AWS with a React frontend, NodeJS Lambda backend and a Postgres data store and I'm really happy with the result but deploying it to AWS was a journey to say the least. I think I've been spoilt by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) which makes deployments very easy. I've used it for multiple [frontend applications](https://cadell.dev) and some backend functions for [Very Nested](https://verynested.cadell.dev) but nothing fullstack because they recommend using another provider like AWS for a data store which largely defeats the purpose of using Netlify in my opinion. I can probably reuse PRAwN Stack](https://prawn.cadell.dev) going forward but what other options are there? Firebase springs to mind but it comes with it's own trade-offs. Vercel and Netlify have raised a lot of money recently, maybe they'll move into this space?

[Cloudflare Pages going fullstack](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29253032) means Cloudflare already is which is particularly exciting because they seem to be moving quickly in general with things like R2. Cloudflare already has a powerful CDN for static assets, workers for backend functions and Durable Objects for a datastore, if they can tie all that together with something half as good as Netlify then that's going to be massive. 

And it doesn't stop there because they also [support WebSockets](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-websockets-in-workers/), allowing us to build realtime applications too! The only thing better than a stateful application is a realtime stateful application, just look at Google Docs and Notion. Cloudflare have recently [reduced the costs of using WebSockets](https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-optimization-reduces-your-bill/) too which is another bonus. Glenn Maddern describes their experience with building a realtime application with Cloudflare really well in this article, [Durable Objects in production](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25084470). It was a massive inspiration for this project.

Diving in deeper, realtime applications are a thing all on their own. There's a range of solutions out there and each has their own trade-offs. CRDTs are pretty hot right now too, like [SyncedStore](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29483913) which builds on [Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs). Another option is [Automerge](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16309533) which looks like it might play nicer with Redux and then there's this fun article on the [performance and optimisations of CRDT solutions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28017204). It goes deep. [Figma found CRDTs were overkill](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21378858) for their use case because they had a central server to act as a source of truth. CRDTs seem better suited for peer to peer communication but they did use them for inspiration.

I decided to do the same. I was already familiar with Redux and it seems perfect for realtime applications. In Redux, users trigger Actions that are then handled by Reducers to update a central data store. Actions already contain all the information required for the Reducer to update the data store, can't we just send them around to build a realtime application? I found [Logux](https://logux.io/), [@localfirst/state](https://github.com/local-first-web/state) and [some others](https://github.com/markerikson/redux-ecosystem-links/blob/master/store.md#synchronization) seem to have a similar idea but I couldn't see how they would work with Cloudflare so I decided against them in favour of rolling my own.

## Solution

![sequence diagram](/sequence.png)
[Sequence Diagram in MermaidJS](https://mermaid.live/edit/#pako:eNrtlD1PwzAQhv_K4YWlDHTM0AlWQEKIJcslftu6JOfiD6qq4r9zIQkFRFvETKbEeZ873yPLO1N7C1MYinjOkBpXjheB21KIc_KS2wpBP_RZc0iudmuWRA8RgS4PrE9L6f_0qYvZ7NGHJ4SCGqTzSLUXQZ0oRycL2qCKvn5Cij3UZxW6yoGrBnRbrTRdUPQtvIA22ihS8ifqfMV_qpd8AKUlxkLOywF03P8SATpAx6D1Kxe1K9U5BEhqtrTkF3wbolfwQXYz0DzLgI-ibnwCBbdYJvJzGpm7hredTtLqCH1b1lb8xe_03-_0D36nn_xGiI3EA3XCLlurUa97DGP-qNaj1K8lqgrB5ii6l7gdjtCEeE-pvUgVIN1eYA-e0z08OP1U4-ydMhPTIrTsrF4cu26pNDpYi9IU-mox59yk0pTyqtG8tpxwbZ1OYoo5NxET090t91upTZFCxhga7p4h9foGWI6T6Q)

After all that background reading, the solution is quite simple. The frontend is a NextJS app with Redux, the API is a Cloudflare Worker and the data store is a Cloudflare Durable Object. The frontend sets up a WebSocket connection with the Worker which then effectively acts as a proxy for the Durable Object. When the connection is first established the Durable Object will send down the current feed of Emojis and remembers the connection for syncing updates later on.

One interesting thing to note is this connection is stored in the Durable Object's memory, instead of persisted storage. This is because the Durable Object is alive for the entire time the client is connected. That's why [Glenn Maddern thinks about them like Stateful Workers](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25084470), rather than Durable Objects, and I have to agree. More on this later.

 Clicking the Add Emoji button creates a new Redux Action which a Reducer handles to update the local data store which then updates the page to display the new emoji using React. Nothing groundbreaking here but here's the fun part. That Action is also sent through the existing WebSocket connection to the Durable Object. The Durable Object then stores that emoji in the persisted feed and broadcasts that Action to other connected users through their WebSocket connections. That Action is received just like the local Action did, updating the local data store with the same Reducer which updates the page to display the new emoji.

This is deployed with Cloudflare Pages which builds our code and deploys it as part of a pipeline triggered on new commits. This is the same experience Netlify provides and it's really nice but I later learned Durable Objects need to be deployed separately. More on that later.

And that's it! That's how I built a stateful, realtime application which, as discussed earlier, is definitely fun.

## Implementation

This was a fun project overall. There were certainly rough parts but now that it's all working I'm really happy with how it's all turned out. Sharing Redux actions over WebSockets works well and the [Durable Object code](https://github.com/cadbox1/random-emojis/blob/main/durable_objects/src/document.ts) looks great.

Glen Maddern describes Durable Objects as Stateful Workers in [Durable Objects in production](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25084470) and I have to agree now that I've worked with them. Durable Objects work just like workers with some persistence methods added on top. This is particularly evident with WebSockets because the Durable Object is kept alive for the entire duration of the connection so we actually store the connection in memory rather the persisting it. I don't think there's much of a distinction between the two options in the docs, maybe because it's only relevant when using WebSockets.

I've built NextJS apps with MDX and custom components [before](https://github.com/cadbox1/prawn-stack) and decided to split them out into a reusable package for this project. The result is [cadells-vanilla-components](https://github.com/cadbox1/cadells-vanilla-components) and it's used in this [NextJS template](https://github.com/cadbox1/cadells-nextjs-template) I built to go with it. Creating the package was a bit harder than I first thought, and it wasn't critical for this project, but I'm really happy with the result and my next NextJS app should be much easy to setup. I originally tried using [tsdx](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/tsdx) but the typescript types weren't correct and I couldn't work out why. I started looking for a tool that used [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) instead of [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) and found [tsup](https://github.com/egoist/tsup) which pretty much worked out of the box. Happy days! Tsdx did introduce me to [np](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np) for publishing to NPM so I brought that over and it works really well. Everything happened for a reason.

## Challenges

My biggest challenge in this project was Cloudflare Pages. As discussed earlier, I chose to use Cloudflare Pages because it sounded like a nice developer experience - just push your code and the build and deployment is handled for you. It goes further than Netlify by offering not only backend functions but also persistence with Durable Objects. They just announced [Cloudflare Pages Goes Full Stack](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-pages-goes-full-stack) and I was keen to ride the hype train.

However, new products and hype trains are often a bit rough around the edges and that was certainly my experience with Cloudflare Pages. I'm extremely happy with the result but it was a bit of a journey to get there. In short:

1. No Function logs.
1. Functions API is slightly different to Workers API.
1. Durable Objects usage isn't well documented.
1. My very first NextJS build failed.
1. Long feedback cycles with each build taking a few minutes.
1. Clicking on an in-progress build doesn't always take you to that build.
1. There was some downtime one day where all builds failed.

None of these were deal breakers but they did subtract from the developer experience. Thankfully, a lot of these should easy to fix.

### No Function Logs
There's no logs for your Functions. Or at least I couldn't find where they are or any documentation about them. This made it very hard to work out what was going wrong and I had to capture each error and send it back in a HTTP response or through the WebSocket, when I eventually worked out how to set that up. This made for long feedback cycles especially when each builds take a few minutes and you're only deploying some code to capture the error. Workers have logs so I suspect it's on the way.

### Functions API
The Functions API is slightly different to the Workers API meaning you have to unravel every Workers example you come across. Now that I'm finished, the differences aren't massive but it definitely adds some overhead when you're getting started, particularly with WebSockets. This is amplified by the lack of Function logs and long feedback cycles discussed above.

### Poor Durable Objects Documentation
Using Durable Objects with Pages is really poorly documented. This is particularly frustrating because Pages support for Durable Objects was a big driver for the project. TL;DR Durable Objects are deployed separately and manually and I've documented the [process here](https://github.com/cadbox1/random-emojis/tree/main/durable_objects).

This blog post on [Building full stack with Pages](https://blog.cloudflare.com/building-full-stack-with-pages#persisting-data) has a code example for Durable Objects that shows a single javascript file at `./durable_objects/downloadCounter.js`. This looked fantastic to me. Just like Functions are automatically deployed from a `functions` folder, Durable Objects are deployed from a `durable_objects` folder. That's not the case because I tried and it didn't work. I think the blog post is a bit misleading and should be updated.

![durable objects usage on their blog](/durable-objects-usage-on-blog.png)

Diving into why, I checked out the [images.pages.dev code example](https://github.com/cloudflare/images.pages.dev) for the blog post. That's where I found an entire package in the [durable_objects folder](https://github.com/cloudflare/images.pages.dev/tree/main/durable_objects) instead of a single javascript file. The README then explains that this is because wrangler v2 doesn't support Durable Objects. I don't know what wrangler is or how it's related to Pages. Adding the package doesn't deploy a Durable Object and that's when I found out you have to deploy the Durable Object manually.

Googling `pages durable objects` takes you to a [page that sounds relevant](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/using-durable-objects/) but it's actually for Workers, not Pages. These are the [Pages Docs for Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/#durable-object-namespace) and they don't reveal much but it does confirm we need to deploy our Durable Object manually

Let's do that by jumping back to the README.

```
npm install;
CF_ACCOUNT_ID="<YOUR CLOUDFLARE ACCOUNT ID>" npm run publish;
```

That doesn't work and I'll quickly go through why:
1. That command doesn't use the wrangler installed as a dependency so it will fail unless you have wrangler installed globally.
1. You need to login to Cloudflare with wrangler first.
1. Deployment will then fail with an error message that loosely mentions your plan and takes you to a blank page in the dashboard. I think this is a bug but you can get around it by signing up to the Workers Paid plan from the dashboard.
1. Your next deploy will fail because you need to agree to some terms. Thankfully, this link works.
1. You need to bind your Durable Object as an environment variable in Pages to use it.

I've documented the actual process in my [Durable Object package](https://github.com/cadbox1/random-emojis/tree/main/durable_objects) but it's basically:
1. Sign up for the Workers Paid plan.
1. Login to Wrangler
1. Try and deploy the Durable Object then accept the license agreement when prompted.
1. Actually deploy the Durable Object.
1. Go into Cloudflare Pages in the Cloudflare Dashboard and bind the newly deployed Durable Object to an environment variable.

So deploys are manual and it was a bit of a journey to get here but the positive is deploys are really fast. It's closer to seconds than minutes and faster than some local environments I've used. I probably wouldn't need a local environment at all when it's this fast and the feedback cycles were much shorter and nicer than Pages. Makes me think I shouldn't have used Pages but more on that later.

### First NextJS Build Failed
This is a small issue but it really hurts the developer experience when a stock NextJS app fails out of the box and Netlify nails this. It's because the [default Node version in Pages is too old for NextJS 12](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/pages-node-js-version-is-too-old-for-nextjs-12/335044) and solution I went with was to include a [.nvmrc](https://github.com/cadbox1/random-emojis/blob/main/.nvmrc) in your project to specify a Node version that is compatible with NextJS 12. I think this is best practice anyway but isn't a nice developer experience for new developers.

### Possible Solution: Use Wrangler Instead of Pages
You could make the case that it would easier than Pages because:
1. There's more documentation for things like WebSockets and Durable Objects.
1. You'll have logs for your Workers.
1. Deploys are faster.
1. You'll have to deploy Durable Objects with Wrangler anyway.

On the other hand:
1. Pages sounds like the long term vision for Cloudflare.
1. A team would probably need a build pipeline.
1. The documentation will get better.
1. Surely they'll have Function logs soon.
1. Durable Objects deployment might get better.
1. Builds will get faster, they've already announced [fast builds](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/cloudflare-pages-fast-builds-open-beta/359897).
