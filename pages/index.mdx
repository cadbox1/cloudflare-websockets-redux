# Random Emojis

A live feed of random emojis using Cloudflare, WebSockets and Redux.

<App />

## User Stories

As one of Cadell's friends, I want a live feed of random emojis so I can send and receive random emojis for some mild amusement.

As Cadell, I want to build a realtime application using WebSockets and Cloudflare because they sound cool and I haven't used them before.

As Cadell, I want to build a stateful application using Cloudflare's Durable Objects so I can consider it for future applications, like [Very Nested](https://verynested.cadell.dev).

## Background

Cloudflare is pretty hot at the moment. They've announced [R2](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28682237), a serious and cheaper alternative to AWS S3 with a smooth migration path, [Cloudflare Pages has gone full stack](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29253032), allowing you to deploy fullstack applications with ease, and Durable Objects, a new kind of data store that [sounds really interesting](https://blog.cloudflare.com/durable-objects-easy-fast-correct-choose-three/).

I've got a soft spot for stateful applications. Stateful applications allow you to store and retrieve data, probably in the cloud, and that can be really fun because it allows people to interacts with each other. I made a chat app 12 years ago in high school using a LAMP stack on free hosting and I can confirm it was fun. The free hosting then went on to get hacked, leaking my severely used password to the world. More fun!

[PRAwN Stack](https://prawn.cadell.dev) was my most recent stateful application and I deployed it on AWS. I'm really happy with the result but deploying it to AWS was a journey to say the least. I think products like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) have spoilt me by making apps incredibly easy to deploy to the point where it's actually fun. I've used it for multiple [frontend applications](https://cadell.dev) and a few backend functions but nothing stateful because they don't have have their own data store. They recommend using another provider like AWS for that which largely defeats the purpose of using Netlify in my opinion. I can use [PRAwN Stack](https://prawn.cadell.dev) for stateful applications going forward but what are the other options? Firebase springs to mind but comes with it's own trade-offs. I don't really know of any others. Vercel and Netlify have raised a lot of money recently, maybe they'll move into this space?

[Cloudflare Pages going fullstack](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29253032) means Cloudflare already is. This is particularly exciting because, as discussed earlier, Cloudflare is pretty hot at the moment. They already have a powerful CDN for static assets, Workers for backend functions and Durable Objects for a data store. If they can tie that all together with a nice developer experience that's half as good as Netlify then I think that's going to be massive. All board the hype train. 

It doesn't stop there. [Cloudflare also support WebSockets](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-websockets-in-workers/) allowing us to build realtime applications, and the only thing better than a stateful application is a realtime, stateful application. Just look at Google Docs and Notion. We can use WebSockets, Workers and Durable Objects together to create stateful applications that updates live, in realtime. Glenn Maddern has an excellent article on their experience with this stack, [Durable Objects in production](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25084470), and it's been a big inspiration for this project and write-up.

Diving in deeper, realtime applications are a thing all on their own. There's a range of solutions out there, each with their own trade-offs. CRDTs sound relevant and they're a hot topic at the moment. I just read about [SyncedStore](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29483913), which uses [Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs), then there's [Automerge](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16309533), which might work better with Redux, and then here's a fun article on the [performance and optimisations of CRDT solutions](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28017204). It goes deep. [Figma found CRDTs were overkill](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21378858) for their use case because they had a central data store to act as a source of truth. They found CRDTs were better suited for peer to peer communication but they did use them as inspiration for their solution.

I decided to do the same. I have a central data store to act as the source of truth and I'm already familiar with Redux which seems perfect for realtime applications. In Redux, users trigger Actions that are then handled by Reducers to update a central, local data store. Actions already contain all the information required for the Reducer to update the data store so can't we just send them around to build a realtime application? I found [Logux](https://logux.io/), [@localfirst/state](https://github.com/local-first-web/state) and [some others](https://github.com/markerikson/redux-ecosystem-links/blob/master/store.md#synchronization) that seem to follow this idea but I couldn't see how they would work with Cloudflare so I decided to roll my own.

## Solution

![sequence diagram](/sequence.png)
[Sequence Diagram in MermaidJS](https://mermaid.live/edit/#pako:eNrtlD1PwzAQhv_K4YWlDHTM0AlWQEKIJcslftu6JOfiD6qq4r9zIQkFRFvETKbEeZ873yPLO1N7C1MYinjOkBpXjheB21KIc_KS2wpBP_RZc0iudmuWRA8RgS4PrE9L6f_0qYvZ7NGHJ4SCGqTzSLUXQZ0oRycL2qCKvn5Cij3UZxW6yoGrBnRbrTRdUPQtvIA22ihS8ifqfMV_qpd8AKUlxkLOywF03P8SATpAx6D1Kxe1K9U5BEhqtrTkF3wbolfwQXYz0DzLgI-ibnwCBbdYJvJzGpm7hredTtLqCH1b1lb8xe_03-_0D36nn_xGiI3EA3XCLlurUa97DGP-qNaj1K8lqgrB5ii6l7gdjtCEeE-pvUgVIN1eYA-e0z08OP1U4-ydMhPTIrTsrF4cu26pNDpYi9IU-mox59yk0pTyqtG8tpxwbZ1OYoo5NxET090t91upTZFCxhga7p4h9foGWI6T6Q).

After all that background reading, the solution is quite simple. The frontend is a NextJS app with Redux, the API is a Cloudflare Worker and the data store is a Cloudflare Durable Object. The frontend sets up a WebSocket connection with the Worker which then acts as a proxy for the Durable Object. When the connection is first established the Durable Object will send down the current feed of Emojis and remembers the connection for syncing updates later on.

One interesting thing to note here is the WebSocket connection is stored in the Durable Object's memory instead of it's persisted storage. We can do this because Durable Objects are alive (and billed) for the entire duration of a WebSocket connection. That's why Glenn Maddern thinks about them more as Stateful Workers, rather than Durable Objects, and I have to agree but more on this later.

 Clicking the Add Emoji button creates a new Redux Action which a Reducer handles to update the local data store. The page is then updated to display the new emoji using React. Nothing groundbreaking here but here's the fun part. The Action is also sent through the WebSocket connection to the Durable Object which then broadcasts the Action to other connected users through their WebSocket connection. It also stores the emoji in the persisted feed for users that join later on. The Actions from the WebSocket connection are handled by Redux in the same way local actions are; a Reducer updates the local store and the page is updated to display the new emoji.

This is all deployed using Cloudflare Pages which gives us a build and deploy pipeline for each commit we make, similar to Netlify. I later learned Durable Objects need to be deployed separately and manually but more on that later.

That's it! That's how I built a fun, realtime, stateful application with Cloudflare.

## Implementation

Overall, this was a fun project. There were certainly rough parts but I'm really happy with the end result now that it's all working. Sharing Redux actions over WebSockets works well and the [Durable Object code](https://github.com/cadbox1/random-emojis/blob/main/durable_objects/src/document.ts) looks great.

Glen Maddern describes Durable Objects as Stateful Workers in [Durable Objects in production](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25084470) and I have to agree. Durable Objects are like Workers with some persistence methods added on top and this is particularly evident when working with WebSockets where most of the code is on the Durable Object. It was also interesting to store the WebSocket connection in the Durable Object's memory instead of using it's persistence methods and this is possible because the Durable Object is kept alive for the duration of the connection. The docs don't really highlight this distinction, maybe because it's only relevant when using WebSockets.

On a bit of a tangent, I also built an NPM package for my frontend components as part of this project. I've built NextJS apps with MDX and custom components [before](https://github.com/cadbox1/prawn-stack) and decided it was time to split them out into a reusable package. The result is [Cadell's Vanilla Components](https://github.com/cadbox1/cadells-vanilla-components) and [Cadell's NextJS template](https://github.com/cadbox1/cadells-nextjs-template). This was a bit harder than first thought and it wasn't strictly required for this project but I'm really happy with the result and my next NextJS app should be much easier to setup. I tried using [tsdx](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/tsdx) but the typescript types weren't correct and I couldn't work out what the problem was. Thankfully, I found [tsup](https://github.com/egoist/tsup) which pretty much worked out of the box. It uses [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) instead of [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup) so that's cool too. Tsdx did introduce me to [np](https://github.com/sindresorhus/np) though, which helps with actually publish to NPM. I'm still using it now and it just goes to show that everything happens for a reason sometimes.

## Challenges

My biggest challenge in this project was Cloudflare Pages. As discussed earlier, I chose Pages because I wanted to deploy full stack apps, with a data store, and have a nice developer experience. They just announced [Cloudflare Pages Goes Full Stack](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-pages-goes-full-stack) and I was keen to ride that hype train.

Unfortunately, new products and hype trains are often a bit rough around the edges and that was certainly my experience here. Again, I'm really happy with the result but it was a journey to get here.

My biggest challenges with Pages were:

1. No Function logs.
1. Durable Objects are poorly documented.
1. My very first NextJS build failed.
1. Slow builds, UI bugs and some downtime.
1. The Functions API is slightly different to the Workers API.

None of these were deal breakers but they did subtract from the developer experience. Thankfully, a lot of these should be easy to fix.

### No Function Logs
There's no logs for the backend Functions deployed with Pages. Or at least I couldn't find them or any documentation about them. This made it very hard to work out what was going wrong and meant I had to write code to capture each error and send it back to the client, either in a HTTP response or through a WebSocket, when I eventually had one. This made for long feedback cycles where each build takes a few minutes, even when you're only deploying code to try and find out what went wrong. Workers have logs so I suspect it's on the way.

### Poor Durable Objects Documentation
Using Durable Objects with Pages is poorly documented. This is really frustrating because Pages supporting Durable Objects was a big driver for the project. The TL;DR is Durable Objects are deployed separately and manually and I've documented the [process here](https://github.com/cadbox1/random-emojis/tree/main/durable_objects) but this was my experience below.

This blog post on [Building full stack with Pages](https://blog.cloudflare.com/building-full-stack-with-pages#persisting-data) has a code example for Durable Objects that shows a single javascript file at `./durable_objects/downloadCounter.js`. This looked fantastic to me because it suggests that Durable Objects are deployed from a `durable_objects` folder just like Functions are deployed from a `functions` folder. Unfortunately, that's not the case.

![durable objects usage on their blog](/durable-objects-usage-on-blog.png)

The [code example](https://github.com/cloudflare/images.pages.dev) for the blog post has a full package in the [durable_objects folder](https://github.com/cloudflare/images.pages.dev/tree/main/durable_objects), instead of the single javascript file the blog shows. The README then explains that this is because Wrangler v2 doesn't support Durable Objects. I didn't know what Wrangler is or how it's related to Pages but I can tell you that adding the package doesn't make Pages deploy the Durable Object. That's when I found out you have to deploy the Durable Object separately and manually.

Googling `pages durable objects` takes you to a [page that sounds relevant](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/learning/using-durable-objects/) but it's actually for Workers, not Pages. These are the [Pages Docs for Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/platform/functions/#durable-object-namespace) and they don't reveal much but it does confirm we need to deploy our Durable Object manually.

Let's do that by jumping back to the README in the code example.

```
npm install;
CF_ACCOUNT_ID="<YOUR CLOUDFLARE ACCOUNT ID>" npm run publish;
```

That doesn't work. 

1. That command doesn't use the Wrangler installed as a dependency so it will fail unless you have Wrangler installed globally.
1. You need to login to Cloudflare with Wrangler first.
1. Deployment will then fail with an error message that loosely mentions your plan and has a link that takes you to a blank page in the dashboard. This is probably bug but you can get around it by signing up to the Workers Paid plan from the dashboard.
1. Your next deploy will fail because you need to agree to some terms. Thankfully, this link works.
1. You then need to bind your Durable Object as an environment variable in the Pages dashboard to use it.

I've documented the actual process in my [Durable Object package](https://github.com/cadbox1/random-emojis/tree/main/durable_objects) but it's basically:

1. Sign up for the Workers Paid plan.
1. Login to Wrangler
1. Try and deploy the Durable Object then accept the license agreement when prompted.
1. Actually deploy the Durable Object.
1. Go into Cloudflare Pages in the Cloudflare Dashboard and bind the newly deployed Durable Object to an environment variable.

So deploys are manual and it was a bit of a journey to work that out but the good things is deploys are really fast. It's closer to seconds than minutes and it's faster than some local environments I've used to the point where I probably wouldn't even need a local environment. This was a welcome relief after how slow Pages builds were. It makes me think maybe I shouldn't have used Pages but more on that later.

### First NextJS Build Failed
The first time you build a stock NextJS app in Cloudflare Pages it will fail. This is a really small issue and it's easy to fix but it really hurts the developer experience particularly when Netlify gets this right. It's because the [default Node version in Pages is too old for NextJS 12](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/pages-node-js-version-is-too-old-for-nextjs-12/335044) and the solution I went with was to include a [.nvmrc](https://github.com/cadbox1/random-emojis/blob/main/.nvmrc) in the project to specify a Node version that is compatible with NextJS 12. I think setting up a `.nvmrc` file or something to specify a project's node version is best practice anyway but new developers aren't going to know this and it's going to be frustrating for them.

### Builds, Bugs and Downtime

This isn't isolated to Cloudflare Pages but each build takes a few minutes, creating long feedback cycles. To make things worse, there seems to be a bug with the builds page where clicking a build doesn't always take you to that build. It seems to have something to do with in-progress builds but I just ended up refreshing the builds page each time which seemed to fix the issue. This makes for a poor experience especially when most of your builds are adding some sort of logging just to work out what went wrong because, as discussed above, there's no logs for Functions.

I eventually became content with slow builds and added it to my "modern development is funny sometimes" list. Then I deployed my Durable Object with Wrangler and saw how fast that was and all my contentment was erased. "What if we could have cloud AND fast feedback cycles!?". More on this later but if you like this idea then you might like this article I cam across about a [A magical AWS serverless developer experience](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30827038) which uses [Serverless Stack (SST)](https://serverless-stack.com/). Pages have since announced [fast builds](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/cloudflare-pages-fast-builds-open-beta/359897) which sounds promising.

The only other thing that's barely worth mentioning is Pages had some downtime where all my builds failed one day. Downtime happens, particularly in betas, but I don't get a lot of time for side projects like this and it was annoying to be blocked after building up the motivation to work on this project. Maybe local development is important after all? I tend to think so but [apparently others aren't so sure](https://dev.to/garethmcc/why-local-development-for-serverless-is-an-anti-pattern-1d9b).

### Functions API
The Functions API is slightly different to the Workers API meaning you have to unravel all the Workers examples you come across. Now that I'm finished, the differences aren't massive but it definitely adds some overhead when you're getting started. Even more so when you're working with WebSockets because there's not a lot of documentation on this so you have to read more code examples. This is further amplified by the lack of Function logs and long feedback cycles discussed above. I also found Googling things for Cloudflare Pages sometimes takes you to Workers docs that aren't relevant which just adds to the confusion.

### Possible Solution: Use Wrangler Instead of Pages
You could make the case that it would be better to use Wrangler over Pages because:

1. There's more documentation for things like WebSockets and Durable Objects.
1. You'll have logs for your Workers.
1. Deploys are faster.
1. You'll have to deploy Durable Objects with Wrangler anyway.

On the other hand:

1. Pages sounds like the long term vision for Cloudflare.
1. A team would probably need a build pipeline.
1. Pages documentation will get better.
1. Surely they'll have Function logs soon.
1. Durable Objects deployment might get better.
1. Builds will get faster. They've already announced [fast builds](https://community.cloudflare.com/t/cloudflare-pages-fast-builds-open-beta/359897).

## Summary

This was an awesome project. I'm really happy with the app, code and Cloudflare, particularly after the challenges I overcame. On the other hand, if I waited a few months and let them polish things up then maybe I wouldn't have so many challenges but then I would miss the hype train! Regardless, I hope Cloudflare can improve the Pages experience based on my feedback and create an awesome product in an exciting space. It probably took longer to write about my experience than it did to actually build the app but I'm working on my writing so I think that's okay.
